# About
So, I got inspired by DvorakDwarf's [Infinite-Storage-Glitch](https://github.com/DvorakDwarf/Infinite-Storage-Glitch) and wanted to try it out myself but in python and the file data would be encrypted using GCMlib. (AES-GCM).

The issue and difference with my project here is that the encrypted data is being stored in a QR code instead of actually in the images/video itself. I have tried LSB, RGB, DCT, and Spacial Domain steganography and ALL have failed when I upload to youtube and then download the video. The compression is just to strong and kills any hope I have. I am also unsure how to use the "Binary" option "ISG" uses in python as I can't really find any documentation or libraries that'd help. I would like help to move away from the QR codes, so anything provided in terms of steganography is very appreciated.

On a good note, I did manage to get all of the other methods mentioned to work with hiding the encrypted data of a .zip/.tar.gz archive in a video file and then reveal/retrieve the data, etc. But I just couldn't get it to work/get past youtube's compression.

# Extra context
When calling the "`encode_video()`" function, it prompts you to provide "`data for keygen`". This is basically any 100+ random characters you can put together. I personally just press all of the buttons of my keyboard in a satisfying way to get a lot of randomly pressed letters, symbols, and numbers. You could also use [Genter](https://github.com/therealOri/Genter) to generate 100+ characters if you want something with a lot more variety than your keyboard.

# Updates

Updated:

- Made the way you control how long a video is and how many frames get used to put a QR code in more convenient.

Updated:

- Youtube compression fix. You should now be able to download the video from youtube and have it extract properly now. ðŸ¤ž
- We are using yt_dlp for downloading videos now.

Updated:

- Encryption method now uses [Chaeslib](https://github.com/therealOri/Chaeslib) instead of only gcm/GCMlib.

- When encoding a file into a video, it will now split the resulting encrypted data into segements. And for each segment that it gets split into, a QR code will be made. The segmented data will then be put into a qr code, and the qr code will be pasted into a frame of the video.

- Updated some if checks for more key verification.

- Fixed some typos and updated some wording.

# How-to
- Archive the files you want to store. (.zip or .tar.gz)
- Upload to qStore and encode a video.
- Upload video to youtube account specifically for these kinds of videos.
- Add record to database to keep track. (if you want)
- Download the video via url/link and then provide to qStore.
- It will extract the data and give you the .zip or .tar.gz file with a "random" name.

> If you are using Ubuntu (linux), you may need to install an additional package `sudo apt-get install zbar-tools` in order for the qr codes to be read. This has happened only 1 time so far so just in case, I'm going to put this little note here.

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/therealOri/qStore.git
cd qStore
virtualenv qstrENV
source qstrENV
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> If you don't have `virtualenv` you can install it via "pip", `pip install virtualenv`.
